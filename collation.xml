</p><p n="1.3">"What's this, <app><lem wit="printed">corporal?"</lem><rdg wit="ms">Corporal?"</rdg></app> the American captain said. "What's the trouble? He's an Englishman.

</p><p n="1.4">"I know he is," the <app><lem wit="printed">policeman</lem><rdg wit="ms">m.p.</rdg></app> said. He spoke <app><lem wit="printed">heavily, breathing heavily,</lem><rdg wit="ms">heavily,</rdg></app> in the voice of a

</p><p n="1.5">The English boy made an effort then. He pulled himself together, focusing his eyes. He 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">swayed, throwing his arms</lem><rdg wit="reader">swayed, throwing his arms</rdg><rdg wit="SEP">swayed, throwing his arm</rdg><rdg wit="ms">threw his arm</rdg></app> about the <app><lem wit="printed">policeman's neck, and</lem><rdg wit="ms">m.p.'s neck and, <unclear>momentarily</unclear> erect,</rdg></app> with the

catching himself <app><lem wit="first-ed">again. "Cheer-o,</lem><rdg wit="reader">again. "Cheer-o,</rdg><rdg wit="SEP">again. "Cheerio,</rdg><rdg wit="ms">again. <add>Erect, he was as tall as anyone there, as tall as the second American.</add> "Cheer-o,</rdg></app> sir," he said. "Name's not Beatty, I hope."

</p><p n="1.6">"No," the captain said.

</p><p n="1.7">"Ah," the English boy said. "Hoped not. My mistake. No offense, <app><lem wit="printed">what?"</lem><rdg wit="ms">eh?</rdg></app>

</p><p n="1.8">"No offense," the captain said quietly. But he was looking at the <app><lem wit="printed">policeman.</lem><rdg wit="ms">m.p.</rdg></app> The second American spoke. He
was a lieutenant, also a pilot. But he was not <app><lem wit="printed">twenty-five</lem><rdg wit="ms">25</rdg></app> and he wore the pink breeches, the London boots,
and his tunic might have been a British tunic save for the collar.

</p><p n="1.9"><app><lem wit="printed">"It's one</lem><rdg wit="ms">"It's just <unclear>another</unclear></rdg></app> of those <app><lem wit="printed">navy eggs,"</lem><rdg wit="ms">naval eggs,"</rdg></app> he said. "They pick them out of the gutters here all night long. You <app><lem wit="printed">don't</lem><rdg wit="ms">dont</rdg></app> come to town often
enough."

</p><p n="1.10">"Oh," the captain said. "I've heard about them. I remember now." <add>He also <app><lem wit="printed">remarked now</lem><rdg wit="ms">remarked <add>then</add></rdg></app>
that, though the street was a <app><lem wit="printed">busy one--it was just outside a popular café</lem><rdg wit="ms">public one, just outside a cafe;</rdg></app>--and there were <app><lem wit="printed">many
passers, soldier, civilian, women,</lem><rdg wit="ms">were lots of passers, soldiers, <unclear>natives</unclear>,</rdg></app> yet none of them so much as <app><lem wit="printed">paused, as though it were a familiar sight.</lem><rdg wit="ms"><del>stopped to</del> paused in passing. 'Maybe this is the way the navy <unclear>fights</unclear>,' he <unclear>thought</unclear>. 'In <unclear>Bretagne</unclear>, anyway.' But the boy was so young.

He was looking at the <app><lem wit="printed">policeman. "Can't</lem><rdg wit="ms">m.p. "Cant</rdg></app> you take him to his ship?"

</p><p n="1.11"><app><lem wit="printed">"I thought of that before the captain did," the policeman said.</lem><rdg wit="ms">"I thought of that, sir," the m.p. said.</rdg></app> "He says he <app><lem wit="printed">can't</lem><rdg wit="ms">cant</rdg></app> go <app><lem wit="printed">aboard his ship</lem><rdg wit="ms">aboard</rdg></app> after <app><lem wit="printed">dark because</lem><rdg wit="ms">dark, because</rdg></app> <app><lem wit="printed">he puts the ship

</lem><rdg wit="ms">the ship is <del>locked up</del> <add>put away in the night</add>." </rdg></app>

</p><p n="1.13">"Stand up, sailor!" <app><lem wit="printed">the policeman said savagely, jerking at his lax burden.</lem><rdg wit="ms">the m.p. said.</rdg></app>
<app><lem wit="printed">"Maybe the captain</lem><rdg wit="ms">"Maybe you</rdg></app> can make sense out of it. <app><lem wit="printed">Damned if I can. He</lem><rdg wit="ms">He</rdg></app> says they keep the boat <app><lem wit="printed">under the wharf.
Run it under the wharf at night,</lem><rdg wit="ms">under the mole <add>at night</add></rdg></app> and that they can't get it out again until the tide goes out tomorrow."


</p><p n="1.14">"Under the <app><lem wit="printed">wharf?</lem><rdg wit="ms">mole?</rdg></app> A boat? <app><lem wit="printed">What is this?"</lem><rdg wit="ms">What does he do?"</rdg></app> He was now <app><lem wit="printed">speaking to the lieutenant.</lem><rdg wit="ms">looking to the <del>lieu</del> other American.</rdg></app> <app><lem wit="printed">"Do they
operate</lem><rdg wit="ms">"--does he operate</rdg></app> some kind of aquatic <app><lem wit="printed">motorcycles?"</lem><rdg wit="ms">motorcycle?"</rdg></app>

</p><p n="1.15">"Something like that," the lieutenant said. "You've seen <app><lem wit="printed">them--the</lem><rdg wit="ms">them, the</rdg></app> boats. Launches, <app><lem wit="printed">camouflaged and all.</lem><rdg wit="ms">painted with camouflage.</rdg></app> <app><lem wit="printed">Dashing up and down the harbor. You've seen them.
They do that all day and sleep in the gutters here all night."
</lem><rdg wit="ms">See them now and then dashing in and out of the harbor."</rdg></app>
</p><p n="1.16">"Oh," the captain said. <app><lem wit="printed">"I thought those boats were ship commanders' launches. You mean to tell me they use officers just to-- "</lem><rdg wit="ms">"They're just captains' launches, aren't they? You dont mean that officers--"</rdg></app>

</p><p n="1.17">"I don't know," the lieutenant said. "Maybe they use them to fetch <app><lem wit="printed">hot water from one ship to another. Or buns.</lem><rdg wit="ms">hot water or buns from one ship to another.</rdg></app> Or
maybe to go <app><lem wit="printed">back and forth fast when they forget</lem><rdg wit="ms">back and get the</rdg></app> napkins or something."

</p><p n="1.18"><app><lem wit="printed">"Nonsense,"</lem><rdg wit="ms">"Oh, come on,"</rdg></app> the captain said. He looked at the English boy again.

</p><p n="1.19">"That's what they do," the lieutenant said. <app><lem wit="printed">"Town's</lem><rdg wit="ms">"The town is</rdg></app> lousy
with them <app><lem wit="printed">all night long.</lem><rdg wit="ms">all night.</rdg></app> Gutters full, 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">and their M. P.'s</lem><rdg wit="reader">and their M.

French give them the launches to get them out of the gutters during the day."</lem><rdg wit="ms">One of their m.p.'s told me what they call these boats. Like he thought that when I heard the name I would know what the boats did. Maybe they built the boats specially to give the guys something to do in the daytime, keeping the gutters clean during the day."</rdg></app>

</p><p n="1.20"><app><lem wit="printed">"Oh," the captain said, "I see."</lem><rdg wit="ms">"I see," the captain said.</rdg></app> But it was clear that he didn't see, wasn't listening, <app><lem wit="printed">didn't believe</lem><rdg wit="ms">and didn't believe</rdg></app> what he did hear. He looked
at the English boy. "Well, you can't leave him here in that <app><lem wit="printed">shape," he said.</lem><rdg wit="ms">shape."</rdg></app>

</p><p n="1.21">Again the English boy <app><lem wit="printed">tried to pull himself together.</lem><rdg wit="ms">was trying to hold himself erect.</rdg></app> "Quite all right, 'sure you," he said glassily, his voice pleasant, cheerful
almost, quite courteous. <app><lem wit="printed">"Used</lem><rdg wit="ms">'Used</rdg></app> to it. Confounded rough <app><lem wit="printed"><hi>pavé</hi>, though.</lem><rdg wit="ms">pavé.</rdg></app> Should force French
do something about it. Visiting lads jolly well <app><lem wit="printed">deserve</lem><rdg wit="ms">should have</rdg></app> decent field to play on, what?"

</p><p n="1.22">"And he was jolly well <app><lem wit="printed">using all of it too," the policeman said savagely.</lem><rdg wit="ms">using it all, too," the m.p. said.</rdg></app> <app><lem wit="printed">"He must think</lem><rdg wit="ms">'He thinks</rdg></app> he's a one-man team,
<app><lem wit="printed">maybe."
</lem><rdg wit="ms">maybe." [no new ¶]</rdg></app>
</p><p n="1.23">At that moment a <app><lem wit="printed">fifth</lem><rdg wit="ms">5th</rdg></app> man came up. He was a British <app><lem wit="printed">military policeman.</lem><rdg wit="ms">m.p. [new ¶]</rdg></app> <app><lem wit="printed">"Nah then," he
said. "What's this? What's this?"</lem><rdg wit="ms">"What's this?" he said. "What's this?"</rdg></app> Then he saw the <app><lem wit="printed">Americans'</lem><rdg wit="ms">American's</rdg></app> shoulder <app><lem wit="printed">bars.</lem><rdg wit="ms">stripes.</rdg></app> He saluted. <app><lem wit="printed">At the sound of his
voice the English</lem><rdg wit="ms">The English</rdg></app> boy <app><lem wit="printed">turned,</lem><rdg wit="ms">had turned,</rdg></app> swaying, peering.

</p><p n="1.24">"Oh, hullo, Albert," he said.

</p><p n="1.25">"Nah then, Mr. Hope," the <app><lem wit="printed">British policeman</lem><rdg wit="ms">m.p.</rdg></app> said. <app><lem wit="printed">He said</lem><rdg wit="ms">He spoke</rdg></app> to the American <app><lem wit="printed">policeman,</lem><rdg wit="ms">m.p.,</rdg></app> over his <app><lem wit="printed">shoulder:</lem><rdg wit="ms">shoulder.</rdg></app> "What is it
this time?"

</p><p n="1.26">"Likely nothing," the <app><lem wit="printed">American said. "The way you guys run a war.</lem><rdg wit="ms">American m.p. said, in your <unclear>sort</unclear> of war.</rdg></app> But <app><lem wit="printed">I'm</lem><rdg wit="ms">I am</rdg></app> a stranger

</p><p n="1.27">"What <app><lem wit="printed">is this,</lem><rdg wit="ms">was it,</rdg></app> corporal?" the captain <app><lem wit="printed">said. "What was he doing?"</lem><rdg wit="ms">said.</rdg></app>

</p><p n="1.28">"He won't call it nothing," the <app><lem wit="printed">American policeman said, jerking</lem><rdg wit="ms">m.p. said, <unclear>pointing</unclear></rdg></app> his head at the British <app><lem wit="printed">policeman.</lem><rdg wit="ms">m.p.</rdg></app> <app><lem wit="printed">"He'll just call it a thrush or a robin or something.

</p><p n="1.40">"You mean, <app><lem wit="printed">they really aren't off of ships?"</lem><rdg wit="ms">not even on the ships?"</rdg></app>

</p><p n="1.41">"Well, <app><lem wit="printed">sir, they might be ships, in a manner of speaking. But

</p><p n="1.42"><app><lem wit="printed">"I see," the captain said.</lem><rdg wit="ms">"One of what ships?"</rdg></app> He looked at the <app><lem wit="printed">policeman.</lem><rdg wit="ms">m.p.</rdg></app> "What kind of boats are they?"

But the captain was not listening.

<head>II</head>

<p n="2.1">Once in the car, he went to sleep immediately with the peaceful suddenness of babies, sitting between the two
Americans. But though the aerodrome was only thirty minutes away, he was awake when they arrived,
apparently quite fresh, and asking for whisky. When they entered the mess he appeared quite sober, only
blinking a little in the lighted room, in his raked cap and his awry-buttoned pea-jacket and a soiled silk
muffler, embroidered with a club insignia which Bogard recognized to have come from a famous
preparatory school, twisted about his throat.

</p><p n="2.2">"Ah," he said, his voice fresh, clear now, not blurred, quite cheerful, quite loud, so that the others in the room turned and looked at him. "Jolly. Whisky, what?"
He went straight as a bird dog to the bar in the corner, the lieutenant following. Bogard had turned and
gone on to the other end of the room, where five men sat about a card table.

</p><p n="2.3">"What's he admiral of?" one said.

</p><p n="2.4">"Of the whole Scotch navy, when I found him," Bogard said.

</p><p n="2.5">Another looked up. "Oh., I thought I'd seen him in town." He looked at the guest. "Maybe it's because he was on his
feet that I didn't recognize him when he came in. You usually see them lying down in the
gutter."

</p><p n="2.6">"Oh," the first said. He, too, looked around. "Is he one of those guys?"

</p><p n="2.7">"Sure. You've seen them. Sitting on the curb, you know, with a couple of limey M. P.'s hauling at their
arms."

</p><p n="2.8">"Yes. I've seen them," the other said. They all looked at the English boy. He stood at the
bar, talking, his voice loud, cheerful. "They all look like him too," the speaker said. "About seventeen or
eighteen. They run those little boats that are always dashing in and out."

</p><p n="2.9">"Is that what they do?" a third said. "You mean, there's a male marine auxiliary to the Waacs? Good Lord, I sure made a mistake
when I enlisted. But this war never was advertised right."

</p><p n="2.10">"I don't know," Bogard said. "I guess they do more than just ride around."

</p><p n="2.11">But they were not listening to him. They were looking at the
guest. "They run by clock," the first said. "You can see the condition of one of them after sunset and almost
tell what time it is. But what I don't see is, how a man that's in that shape at one o'clock every morning can
even see a battleship the next day."

</p><p n="2.12">"Maybe when they have a message to send out to a ship,"
another said, "they just make duplicates and line the launches up and point them toward the ship and give
each one a duplicate of the message and let them go. And the ones that miss the ship just cruise around the
harbor until they hit a dock somewhere."

</p><p n="2.13">"It must be more than that," Bogard said.

</p><p n="2.14">He was
about to say something else, but at that moment the guest turned from the bar and approached, carrying a
glass. He walked steadily enough, but his color was high and his eyes were bright, and he was talking,
loud, cheerful, as he came up.

</p><p n="2.15">"I say. Won't you chaps join-- " He ceased. He seemed to remark
something; he was looking at their breasts. "Oh, I say. You fly. All of you. Oh, good gad! Find it jolly,
eh?"

</p><p n="2.16">"Yes," somebody said. "Jolly."

</p><p n="2.17">"But dangerous, what?"

</p><p n="2.18">"A little faster than
tennis," another said. The guest looked at him, bright, affable, intent.

</p><p n="2.19">Another said quickly,
"Bogard says you command a vessel."

</p><p n="2.20">"Hardly a vessel. Thanks, though. And not command.
Ronnie does that. Ranks me a bit. Age."

</p><p n="2.21">"Ronnie?"

</p><p n="2.22">"Yes. Nice. Good egg. Old, though.
Stickler."

</p><p n="2.23">"Stickler?"

</p><p n="2.24">"Frightful. You'd not believe it. Whenever we sight smoke and I have
the glass, he sheers away. Keeps the ship hull down all the while. No beaver then. Had me two down a
fortnight yesterday."

</p><p n="2.25">The Americans glanced at one another. "No beaver?"

</p><p n="2.26">"We play it.
With basket masts, you see. See a basket mast. Beaver! One up. The Ergenstrasse doesn't count any more,
though."

</p><p n="2.27">The men about the table looked at one another. Bogard spoke. "I see. When you or
Ronnie see a ship with basket masts, you get a beaver on the other. I see. What is the
Ergenstrasse?"

</p><p n="2.28">"She's German. Interned. Tramp steamer. Foremast rigged so it looks something
like a basket mast. Booms, cables, I dare say. I didn't think it looked very much like a basket mast, myself.
But Ronnie said yes. Called it one day. Then one day they shifted her across the basin and I called her on
Ronnie. So we decided to not count her any more. See now, eh?"

</p><p n="2.29">"Oh," the one who had made the
tennis remark said, "I see. You and Ronnie run about in the launch, playing beaver. H'm'm. That's nice. Did
you ever pl--"

</p><p n="2.30">"Jerry," Bogard said. The guest had not moved. He looked down at the speaker, still
smiling, his eyes quite wide.

</p><p n="2.31">The speaker still looked at the guest. "Has yours and Ronnie's boat
got a yellow stern?"

</p><p n="2.32">"A yellow stern?" the English boy said. He had quit smiling, but his face was
still pleasant.

</p><p n="2.33">"I thought that maybe when the boats had two captains, they might paint the sterns
yellow or something."

</p><p n="2.34">"Oh," the guest said. "Burt and Reeves aren't officers."

</p><p n="2.35">"Burt and
Reeves," the other said, in a musing tone. "So they go, too. Do they play beaver too?"

</p><p n="2.36">"Jerry,"
Bogard said. The other looked at him. Bogard jerked his head a little. "Come over here." The other rose.
They went aside. "Lay off of him," Bogard said. "I mean it, now. He's just a kid. When you were that age,
how much sense did you have? Just about enough to get to chapel on time."

</p><p n="2.37">"My country hadn't
been at war going on four years, though," Jerry said. "Here we are, spending our money and getting shot at
by the clock, and it's not even our fight, and these limeys that would have been goose-stepping twelve
months now if it hadn't been--"

</p><p n="2.38">"Shut it," Bogard said. "You sound like a Liberty Loan."

</p><p n="2.39">"--taking it like it was a fair or something. 'Jolly.'" His voice was now falsetto, lilting. "'But dangerous,
what?'"

</p><p n="2.40">"Sh-h-h-h," Bogard said.

</p><p n="2.41">"I'd like to catch him and his Ronnie out in the harbor,
just once. Any harbor. London's. I wouldn't want anything but a Jenny, either. Jenny? Hell, I'd take a
bicycle and a pair of water wings! I'll show him some war."

</p><p n="2.42">"Well, you lay off him now. He'll be
gone soon."

</p><p n="2.43">"What are you going to do with him?"

</p><p n="2.44">"I'm going to take him along this
morning. Let him have Harper's place out front. He says he can handle a Lewis. Says they have one on the
boat. Something he was telling me--about how he once shot out a channel-marker light at seven hundred
yards."

</p><p n="2.45">"Well, that's your business. Maybe he can beat you."

</p><p n="2.46">"Beat me?"

</p><p n="2.47">"Playing
beaver. And then you can take on Ronnie."

</p><p n="2.48">"I'll show him some war, anyway," Bogard said. He
looked at the guest. "His people have been in it three years now, and he seems to take it like a sophomore
in town for the big game." He looked at Jerry again. "But you lay off him now."

</p><p n="2.49">As they
approached the table, the guest's voice was loud and cheerful: ". . . if he got the glasses first, he would go in
close and look, but when I got them first, he'd sheer off where I couldn't see anything but the smoke.
Frightful stickler. Frightful. But Ergenstrasse not counting any more. And if you make a mistake and call
her, you lose two beaver from your score. If Ronnie were only to forget and call her we'd be
even."</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section" n="3">
<head>III</head>

<p n="3.1">At two o'clock the English boy was still talking, his
voice bright, innocent and cheerful. He was telling them how Switzerland had been spoiled by 1914, and
instead of the vacation which his father had promised him for his sixteenth birthday, when that birthday
came he and his tutor had had to do with Wales. But that he and the tutor had got pretty high and that he
dared to say--with all due respect to any present who might have had the advantage of Switzerland, of
course--that one could see probably as far from Wales as from Switzerland. "Perspire as much and breathe
as hard, anyway," he added. And about him the Americans sat, a little hard-bitten, a little sober, somewhat
older, listening to him with a kind of cold astonishment. They had been getting up for some time now and
going out and returning in flying clothes, carrying helmets and goggles. An orderly entered with a tray of
coffee cups, and the guest realized that for some time now he had been hearing engines in the darkness
outside.

</p><p n="3.2">At last Bogard rose. "Come along," he said. "We'll get your togs." When they emerged
from the mess, the sound of the engines was quite loud--an idling thunder. In alignment along the invisible
tarmac was a vague rank of short banks of flickering blue-green fire suspended apparently in mid-air. They
crossed the aerodrome to Bogard's quarters, where the lieutenant, McGinnis, sat on a cot fastening his
flying boots. Bogard reached down a Sidcott suit and threw it across the cot. "Put this on," he
said.

</p><p n="3.3">"Will I need all this?" the guest said. "Shall we be gone that long?"

</p><p n="3.4">"Probably,"
Bogard said. "Better use it. Cold upstairs."

</p><p n="3.5">The guest picked up the suit. "I say," he said. 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">"I say. Ronnie</lem><rdg wit="SEP">"I say. Ronnie</rdg><rdg wit="reader">"I say, Ronnie</rdg></app> 
and I have a do ourselves, tomor--today. Do you think Ronnie won't mind if I am a bit late? Might
not wait for me."

</p><p n="3.6">"We'll be back before teatime," McGinnis said.

</p><p n="3.7"> He seemed quite busy
with his boot. "Promise you." The English boy looked at him.

</p><p n="3.8">"What time should you be back?"
Bogard said.

</p><p n="3.9">"Oh, well," the English boy said, "I dare say it will be all right. They let Ronnie say
when to go, anyway. He'll wait for me if I should be a bit late."

</p><p n="3.10">"He'll wait," Bogard said. "Get
your suit on."

</p><p n="3.11">"Right," the other said. They helped him into the suit. "Never been up before," he
said, chattily, pleasantly. "Dare say you can see farther than from mountains, eh?"

</p><p n="3.12">"See more,
anyway," McGinnis said. "You'll like it."

</p><p n="3.13">"Oh, rather. If Ronnie only waits for me. Lark. But
dangerous, isn't it?"

</p><p n="3.14">"Go on," McGinnis said. "You're kidding me."

</p><p n="3.15">"Shut your trap, Mac,"
Bogard said. "Come along. Want some more coffee?" He looked at the guest, but McGinnis
answered:

</p><p n="3.16">"No. Got something better than coffee. Coffee makes such a confounded stain on the
wings."

</p><p n="3.17">"On the wings?" the English boy said. "Why coffee 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">on the wings?"</lem><rdg wit="SEP">on the wings?"</rdg><rdg wit="reader">on the wings."</rdg></app>

</p><p n="3.18">"Stow it, I said,
Mac," Bogard said. "Come along."

</p><p n="3.19">They recrossed the aerodrome, approaching the muttering
banks of flame. When they drew near, the guest began to discern the shape, the outlines, of the Handley-Page. 
It looked like a Pullman coach run upslanted aground into the skeleton of the first floor of an
incomplete skyscraper. The guest looked at it quietly.

</p><p n="3.20">"It's larger than a cruiser," he said in his
bright, interested voice. "I say, you know. This doesn't fly in one lump. You can't pull my leg. Seen them
before. It comes in two parts: Captain Bogard and me in one; Mac and 'nother chap in other.
What?"

</p><p n="3.21">"No," McGinnis said. Bogard had vanished. "It all goes up in one lump. Big lark, eh?
Buzzard, what?"

</p><p n="3.22">"Buzzard?" the guest murmured. "Oh, I say. A cruiser. Flying. I 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">say,</lem><rdg wit="reader">say,</rdg><rdg wit="SEP" cause="broken_type_comma">say</rdg></app>
now."

</p><p n="3.23">"And listen," McGinnis said. His hand came forth; something cold fumbled against the hand
of the English boy--a bottle. "When you feel yourself getting sick, see? Take a pull at it."

</p><p n="3.24">"Oh,
shall I get sick?"

</p><p n="3.25">"Sure. We all do. Part of flying. This will stop it. But if it doesn't.
See?"

</p><p n="3.26">"What? Quite. What?"

</p><p n="3.27">"Not overside. Don't spew it overside."

</p><p n="3.28">"Not
overside?"

</p><p n="3.29">"It'll blow back in Bogy's and my face. Can't see. Bingo. Finished. See?"

</p><p n="3.30">"Oh,
quite. What shall I do with it?" Their voices were quiet, brief, grave as conspirators.

</p><p n="3.31">"Just duck
your head and let her go."

</p><p n="3.32">"Oh, quite."

</p><p n="3.33">Bogard returned. "Show him how to get into the
front pit, will you?" he said. McGinnis led the way through the trap. Forward, rising to the slant of the
fuselage, the passage narrowed; a man would need to crawl.

</p><p n="3.34">"Crawl in there and keep going,"
McGinnis said.

</p><p n="3.35">"It looks like a dog kennel," the guest said.

</p><p n="3.36">"Doesn't it, though?" McGinnis
agreed cheerfully. "Cut along with you." Stooping, he could hear the other scuttling forward. "You'll find a
Lewis gun up there, like as not," he said into the tunnel.

</p><p n="3.37">The voice of the guest came back: "Found
it."

</p><p n="3.38">"The gunnery sergeant will be along in a minute and show you if it is loaded."

</p><p n="3.39">"It's
loaded," the guest said; almost on the heels of his words the gun fired, a brief staccato burst. There were
shouts, the loudest from the ground beneath the nose of the aeroplane. "It's quite all right," the English
boy's voice said. "I pointed it west before I let it off. Nothing back there but Marine office and your brigade
headquarters. Ronnie and I always do this before we go anywhere. Sorry if I was too soon. Oh, by the
way," he added, "my name's Claude. Don't think I mentioned it."

</p><p n="3.40">On the ground, Bogard and two
other officers stood. They had come up running. "Fired it west," one said. "How in hell does he know
which way is west?"

</p><p n="3.41">"He's a sailor," the other said. "You forgot that."

</p><p n="3.42">"He seems to be a
machine gunner too," Bogard said.

</p><p n="3.43">"Let's hope he doesn't forget that," the first
said.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section" n="4">
<head>IV</head>

<p n="4.1">Nevertheless, Bogard kept an eye on the silhouetted head rising
from the round gunpit in the nose ten feet ahead of him. "He did work that gun, though," he said to
McGinnis beside him. "He even put the drum on himself, didn't he?"

</p><p n="4.2">"Yes," McGinnis said. "If he
just doesn't forget and think that that gun is him and his tutor looking around from a Welsh
alp."

</p><p n="4.3">"Maybe I should not have brought him," Bogard said. McGinnis didn't answer. Bogard
jockeyed the wheel a little. Ahead, in the gunner's pit, the guest's head moved this way and that
continuously, looking. "We'll get there and unload and haul air for home," Bogard said. "Maybe in the
dark--Confound it, it would be a shame for his country to be in this mess for four years and him not even to
see a gun pointed in his direction."

</p><p n="4.4">"He'll see one tonight if he don't keep his head in," McGinnis
said.

</p><p n="4.5">But the boy did not do that. Not even when they had reached the objective and McGinnis had
crawled down to the bomb toggles. And even when the searchlights found them and Bogard signaled to the
other machines and dived, the two engines snarling full speed into and through the bursting shells, he could
see the boy's face in the searchlight's glare, leaned far overside, coming sharply out as a spot-lighted face
on a stage, with an expression upon it of childlike interest and delight. "But he's firing that Lewis," Bogard
thought. "Straight too"; nosing the machine farther down, watching the pinpoint swing into the sights, his
right hand lifted, waiting to drop into McGinnis' sight. He dropped his hand; above the noise of the engines
he seemed to hear the click and whistle of the released bombs as the 
<app><lem wit="SEP">machine, freed</lem><rdg wit="reader">machine, freed</rdg><rdg wit="first-ed">machine freed</rdg></app> of the weight, shot
zooming in a long upward bounce that carried it for an instant out of the light. Then he was pretty busy for
a time, coming into and through the shells again, shooting athwart another beam that caught and held long
enough for him to see the English boy leaning far over the side, looking back and down past the right wing,
the undercarriage. "Maybe he's read about it somewhere," Bogard thought, turning, looking back to pick up
the rest of the flight.

</p><p n="4.6">Then it was all over, the darkness cool and empty and peaceful and almost
quiet, with only the steady sound of the engines. McGinnis climbed back into the office, and standing up in
his seat, he fired the colored pistol this time and stood for a moment longer, looking backward toward
where the search-lights still probed and sabered. He sat down again.

</p><p n="4.7">"O.K.," he said. "I counted all
four of them. Let's haul air." Then he looked forward. "What's become of the King's Own? You didn't hang
him onto a bomb release, did you?" Bogard looked. The forward pit was empty. It was in dim silhouette
again now, against the stars, but there was nothing there now save the gun. "No," 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">McGinnis said;</lem><rdg wit="SEP">McGinnis said;</rdg><rdg wit="reader">McGinnis said:</rdg></app> 
"there he is. See? Leaning overside. Dammit, I told him not to spew it! There he comes back." The guest's head came
into view again. But again it sank out of sight.

</p><p n="4.8">"He's coming back," Bogard said. "Stop him. Tell
him we're going to have every squadron in the Hun Channel group on top of us in thirty
minutes."

</p><p n="4.9">McGinnis swung himself down and stooped at the entrance to the passage. "Get back!"
he shouted.

</p><p n="4.10"> The other was almost out; they squatted so, face to face like two dogs, shouting at one
another above the noise of the still-unthrottled engines on either side of the fabric walls. The English boy's
voice was thin and high.

</p><p n="4.11">"Bomb!" he shrieked.

</p><p n="4.12">"Yes," McGinnis 
<app><lem wit="SEP">shouted,</lem><rdg wit="reader">shouted,</rdg><rdg wit="first-ed">shouted.</rdg></app> "they were bombs! We gave them
hell! Get back, I tell you! Have every Hun in France on us in ten minutes! Get back to your
gun!"

</p><p n="4.13">Again the boy's voice came, high, faint above the noise: "Bomb! All right?"

</p><p n="4.14">"Yes!
Yes! All right. Back to your gun, damn you!"

</p><p n="4.15">McGinnis climbed back into the office. "He went
back. Want me to take her awhile?"

</p><p n="4.16">"All right," Bogard said. He passed McGinnis the wheel. "Ease
her back some. I'd just as soon it was daylight when they come down on us."

</p><p n="4.17">"Right," McGinnis
said. He moved the wheel suddenly. "What's the matter with that right wing?" he said. "Watch it. . . . See?
I'm flying on the right aileron and a little rudder. Feel it."

</p><p n="4.18">Bogard took the wheel a moment. "I
didn't notice that. Wire somewhere, I guess. I didn't think any of those shells were that close. Watch her,
though."

</p><p n="4.19">"Right," McGinnis said. "And so you are going with him on his boat tomorrow--today."

</p><p n="4.20">"Yes. I promised him. Confound it, you can't hurt a kid, you know."

</p><p n="4.21">"Why don't
you take Collier along, with his mandolin? Then you could sail around and sing."

</p><p n="4.22">"I promised
him," Bogard said. "Get that wing up a little."

</p><p n="4.23">"Right," McGinnis said.

</p><p n="4.24">Thirty minutes later
it was beginning to be dawn; the sky was gray. Presently McGinnis said: "Well, here they come. Look at
them! They look like mosquitoes in September. I hope he don't get worked up now and think he's playing
beaver. If he does he'll just be one down to Ronnie, provided the devil has a beard . . . . Want the
wheel?"</p>

<p n="5.1">At eight o'clock the beach, the Channel, was beneath them.
Throttled back, the machine drifted down as Bogard ruddered it gently into the Channel wind. His face was
strained, a little tired.

</p><p n="5.2">McGinnis looked tired, too, and he needed a shave.

</p><p n="5.3">"What do you
guess he is looking at now?" he said. For again the English boy was leaning over the right side of the
cockpit, looking backward and downward past the right wing.

</p><p n="5.4">"I don't know," Bogard said.
"Maybe bullet holes." He blasted the port engine. "Must have the riggers--"

</p><p n="5.5">"He could see some
closer than that," McGinnis said. "I'll swear I saw tracer going into his back at one time. Or maybe it's the
ocean he's looking at. But he must have seen that when he came over from England." Then Bogard leveled
off; the nose rose sharply, the sand, the curling tide edge fled along-side. Yet still the English boy hung far
overside, looking backward and downward at something beneath the right wing, his face rapt, with utter
and childlike interest. Until the machine was completely stopped he continued to do so. Then he ducked
down, and in the abrupt silence of the engines they could hear him crawling in the passage. He emerged
just as the two pilots climbed stiffly down from the office, his face bright, eager; his voice high,
excited.

</p><p n="5.6">"Oh, I say! Oh, good gad! 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">What a chap!</lem><rdg wit="SEP">What a chap!</rdg><rdg wit="reader">What a chap.</rdg></app> 
What a judge of distance! If Ronnie could only
have seen! Oh, good gad! Or maybe they aren't like ours--don't load themselves as soon as the air strikes
them."

</p><p n="5.7">The Americans looked at him. "What don't what?" 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">McGinnis said.</lem><rdg wit="SEP">McGinnis said.</rdg><rdg wit="reader">McGinnis said.[no new ¶]</rdg></app>

</p><p n="5.8">"The bomb. It
was magnificent; I say, I shan't forget it. Oh, I say, you know! It was splendid!"

</p><p n="5.9">After a while
McGinnis said, "The bomb?" in a fainting voice. Then the two pilots glared at each other; they said in
unison: "That right wing!" Then as one they clawed down through the trap and, with the guest at their
heels, they ran around the machine and looked beneath the right wing. The bomb, suspended by its tail,
hung straight down like a plumb bob beside the right wheel, its tip just touching the sand. And parallel with
the wheel track was the long, delicate line in the sand where its ultimate tip had dragged. Behind them the
English boy's voice was high, clear, childlike:

</p><p n="5.10">"Frightened, myself. Tried to tell you. But realized
you knew your business better than I. Skill. Marvelous. Oh, I say, I shan't forget
it."</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section" n="6">
<head>VI</head>

<p n="6.1">A marine with a bayoneted rifle passed Bogard onto the wharf and
directed him to the boat. The wharf was empty, and he didn't even see the boat until he approached the
edge of the wharf and looked directly down into it and upon the backs of two stooping men in greasy
dungarees, who rose and glanced briefly at him and stooped again.

</p><p n="6.2">It was about thirty feet long and
about three feet wide. It was painted with gray-green camouflage. It was quarter-decked forward, with two
blunt, raked exhaust stacks. "Good Lord," Bogard thought, "if all that deck is engine--" Just aft the deck
was the control seat; he saw a big wheel, an instrument panel. Rising to a height of about a foot above the
free-board, and running from the stern forward to where the deck began, and continuing on across the after
edge of the deck and thence back down the other gunwale to the stern, was a solid screen, also
camouflaged, which inclosed the boat save for the width of the stern, which was open. Facing the
steersman's seat like an eye was a hole in the screen about eight inches in diameter. And looking down into
the long, narrow, still, vicious shape, he saw a machine gun swiveled at the stern, and he looked at the low
screen--including which the whole vessel did not sit much more than a yard above water level--with its
single empty forward-staring eye, and he thought quietly: "It's steel. It's made of steel." And his face was
quite sober, quite thoughtful, and he drew his trench coat about him and buttoned it, as though he were
getting cold.

</p><p n="6.3">He heard steps behind him and turned. But it was only an orderly from the aerodrome,
accompanied by the marine with the rifle. The orderly was carrying a largish bundle wrapped in
paper.

</p><p n="6.4">"From Lieutenant McGinnis to the captain," the orderly said.

</p><p n="6.5">Bogard took the
bundle. The orderly and the marine retreated. He opened the bundle. It contained some objects and a
scrawled note. The objects were a new yellow silk sofa cushion and a Japanese parasol, obviously
borrowed, and a comb and a 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">roll of toilet</lem><rdg wit="reader">roll of toilet</rdg><rdg wit="SEP">few sheets of flimsy</rdg></app> paper. The note said:

</p><p n="6.6"><q>Couldn't find a camera anywhere and Collier wouldn't let me have his
mandolin. But maybe Ronnie can play on the comb.</q><q>MAC.</q>

</p><p n="6.7">Bogard looked at
the objects. But his face was still quite thoughtful, quite grave. He rewrapped the things and carried the
bundle on up the 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">wharf a way and</lem><rdg wit="SEP">wharf a way and</rdg><rdg wit="reader">wharf and</rdg></app> dropped it quietly into the water.

</p><p n="6.8">As he returned toward the
invisible boat he saw two men approaching. He recognized the boy at once--tall, slender, already talking,
voluble, his head bent a little toward his shorter companion, who plodded along 

</p><p n="6.9">beside him, hands
in pockets, smoking a pipe. The boy still wore the pea-coat beneath a flapping oilskin, but in place of the
rakish and casual cap he now wore an infantryman's soiled Balaclava helmet, with, floating behind him as
though upon the sound of his voice, a curtainlike piece of cloth almost as long as a
burnous.

</p><p n="6.10">"Hullo, there!" he cried, still a hundred yards away.

</p><p n="6.11">But it was the second man
that Bogard was watching, thinking to himself that he had never in his life seen a more curious figure.
There was something stolid about the very shape of his hunched shoulders, his slightly down-looking face.
He was a head shorter than the other. His face was ruddy, too, but its mold was of a profound gravity that
was almost dour. It was the face of a man of twenty who has been for a year trying, even while asleep, to
look twenty-one. He wore a high-necked sweater and dungaree slacks; above this a leather jacket; and
above this a soiled naval officer's warmer that reached almost to his heels and which had one shoulder strap
missing and not one remaining button at all. On his head was a plaid fore-and-aft deer stalker's cap, tied on
by a narrow scarf brought across and down, hiding his ears, and then wrapped once about his throat and
knotted with a hangman's noose beneath his left ear. It was unbelievably soiled, and with his hands elbow-deep 
in his pockets and his hunched shoulders and his bent head, he looked like someone's grandmother
hung, say, for a witch. Clamped upside down between his teeth was a short brier pipe.

</p><p n="6.12">"Here he
is!" the boy cried. "This is Ronnie. Captain Bogard."

</p><p n="6.13">"How are you?" Bogard said. He extended his
hand. The other said no word, but his hand came forth, limp. It was quite cold, but it was hard, calloused.
But he said no word; he just glanced briefly at Bogard and then away. But in that instant Bogard caught
something in the look, something strange--a flicker; a kind of covert and curious respect, something like a
boy of fifteen looking at a circus trapezist.

</p><p n="6.14">But he said no word. He ducked on; Bogard watched
him drop from sight over the wharf edge as though he had jumped feet first into the sea. He remarked now
that the engines in the invisible boat were running.

</p><p n="6.15">"We might get aboard too," the boy said. He
started toward the boat, then he stopped. He touched Bogard's arm. "Yonder!" he hissed. "See?" His voice
was thin with excitement.

</p><p n="6.16">"What?" Bogard also whispered; automatically he looked backward and
upward, after old habit. The other was gripping his arm and pointing across the harbor.

</p><p n="6.17">"There!
Over there. The Ergenstrasse. They have shifted her again." Across the harbor lay an ancient, rusting,
sway-backed hulk. It was small and nondescript, and, remembering, Bogard saw that the fore-mast was a
strange mess of cables and booms, resembling--allowing for a great deal of license or looseness of
imagery--a basket mast. Beside him the boy was almost chortling. "Do you think that Ronnie noticed?" he
hissed. "Do you?"

</p><p n="6.18">"I don't know," Bogard said.

</p><p n="6.19">"Oh, good gad! If he should glance up and
call her before he notices, we'll be even. Oh, good gad! 

</p><p n="6.20">But come along." He went on; he was still
chortling. "Careful," he said. "Frightful ladder."

</p><p n="6.21">He descended first, the two men in the boat rising
and saluting. Ronnie had disappeared, save for his backside, which now filled a small hatch leading
forward beneath the deck. Bogard descended gingerly.

</p><p n="6.22">"Good Lord," he said. "Do you have to
climb up and down this every day?"

</p><p n="6.23">"Frightful, isn't it?" the other said, in his happy voice. "But
you know yourself. Try to run a war with makeshifts, then wonder why it takes so long." The narrow hull
slid and surged, even with Bogard's added weight. "Sits right on top, you see," the boy said. "Would float
on a lawn, in a heavy dew. Goes right over them like a bit of paper."

</p><p n="6.24">"It does?" Bogard
said.

</p><p n="6.25">"Oh, absolutely. That's why, you see." Bogard didn't see, but he was too busy letting himself
gingerly down to a sitting posture. There were no thwarts; no seats save a long, thick, cylindrical ridge
which ran along the bottom of the boat from the driver's seat to the stern. Ronnie had backed into sight. He
now sat behind the wheel, bent over the instrument panel. But when he glanced back over his shoulder he
did not speak. His face was merely interrogatory. Across his face there was now a long smudge of grease.
The boy's face was empty, too, now.

</p><p n="6.26">"Right," he said. He looked forward, where one of the seamen
had gone. "Ready forward?" he said.

</p><p n="6.27">"Aye, sir," the seaman said.

</p><p n="6.28">The other seaman was at
the stern line. "Ready aft?"

</p><p n="6.29">"Aye, sir."

</p><p n="6.30">"Cast off." The boat sheered away, purring, a
boiling of water under the stern. The boy looked down at Bogard. "Silly business. Do it shipshape, though.
Can't tell when silly fourstriper--" His face changed again, immediate, solicitous. "I say. Will you be
warm? I never thought to fetch--"

</p><p n="6.31">"I'll be all right," Bogard said. But the other was already taking
off his oilskin. "No, no," Bogard said. "I won't take it."

</p><p n="6.32">"You'll tell me if you get
cold?"

</p><p n="6.33">"Yes. Sure." He was looking down at the cylinder on which he sat. It was a half cylinder--that 
is, like the hot-water tank to some Gargantuan stove, sliced down the middle and bolted, open side
down, to the floor plates. It was twenty feet long and more than two feet thick. Its top rose as high as the
gunwales and between it and the hull on either side was just room enough for a man to place his feet to
walk.

</p><p n="6.34">"That's Muriel," the boy said.

</p><p n="6.35">"Muriel?"

</p><p n="6.36">"Yes. The one before that was
Agatha. After my aunt. The first one Ronnie and I had was Alice in Wonderland. Ronnie and I were the
White Rabbit. Jolly, eh?"

</p><p n="6.37">"Oh, you and Ronnie have had three, have you?"

</p><p n="6.38">"Oh, yes," the
boy said. He leaned down. "He didn't notice," he whispered. His face was again bright, gleeful. "When we
come back," he said. "You watch."

</p><p n="6.39">"Oh," Bogard said. "The Ergenstrasse." He looked astern, and
then he thought: "Good Lord! We must be going--traveling." He looked out now, broadside, and saw the
harbor line fleeing past, and he thought to himself that the boat was well-nigh moving at the speed at which
the Handley-Page flew, left the ground. They were beginning to bound now, even in the sheltered water,
from one wave crest to the next with a distinct shock. His hand still rested on the cylinder on which he sat.
He looked down at it again, following it from where it seemed to emerge beneath Ronnie's seat, to where it
beveled into the stern. "It's the air 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">in here,</lem><rdg wit="SEP">in here,</rdg><rdg wit="reader">in her,</rdg></app> I suppose," he said.

</p><p n="6.40">"The what?" the boy
said.

</p><p n="6.41">"The air. Stored up 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">in here.</lem><rdg wit="SEP">in here.</rdg><rdg wit="reader">in her.</rdg></app> That makes the boat ride high."

</p><p n="6.42">"Oh, yes. I dare say. Very
likely. I hadn't thought about it." He came forward, his burnous whipping in the wind, and sat down beside
Bogard. Their heads were below the top of the screen.

</p><p n="6.43">Astern the harbor fled, diminishing, sinking
into the sea. The boat had begun to lift now, swooping forward and down, shocking almost stationary for a
moment, then lifting and swooping again; a gout of spray came aboard over the bows like a flung shovelful
of shot. "I wish you'd take this coat," the boy said.

</p><p n="6.44">Bogard didn't answer. He looked around at the
bright face. "We're outside, aren't we?" he said quietly.

</p><p n="6.45">"Yes. . . . Do take it, won't
you?"

</p><p n="6.46">"Thanks, no. I'll be all right. We won't be long, anyway, I guess."

</p><p n="6.47">"No. We'll turn
soon. It won't be so bad then."

</p><p n="6.48">"Yes. I'll be all right when we turn." Then they did turn. The motion
became easier. That is, the boat didn't bang head-on, shuddering, into the swells. They came up beneath
now, and the boat fled with increased speed, with a long, sickening, 
<app><lem wit="SEP">yawing</lem><rdg wit="reader">yawing</rdg><rdg wit="first-ed">yawning</rdg></app> motion, first to one side and then the
other. But it fled on, and Bogard looked astern with that same soberness with which he had first looked
down into the boat. "We're going east now," he said.

</p><p n="6.49">"With just a spot of north," the boy said.
"Makes her ride a bit better, what?"

</p><p n="6.50">"Yes," Bogard said. Astern there was nothing now save empty
sea and the delicate needlelike cant of the machine gun against the boiling and slewing wake, and the two
seamen crouching quietly in the stern. "Yes. It's easier." Then he said: "How far do we go?"

</p><p n="6.51">The
boy leaned closer. He moved closer. His voice was happy, confidential, proud, though lowered a little: "It's
Ronnie's show. He thought of it. Not that I wouldn't have, in time. Gratitude and all that. But he's the older,
you see. Thinks fast. Courtesy, <hi>noblesse oblige</hi>--all that. Thought of it soon as I told him this
morning. I said, 'Oh, I say. I've been there. I've seen it'; and he said, 'Not flying'; and I said, 'Strewth'; and
he said 'How far? No lying now'; and I said, 'Oh, far. Tremendous. Gone all night'; and he said, 'Flying all
night. That must have been to Berlin'; and I said, 'I don't know. I dare say'; and he thought. I could see him
thinking. Because he is the older, you see. More experience in courtesy, right thing. And he said, 'Berlin.
No fun to that chap, dashing out and back with us.' And he thought and I waited, and I said, 'But we can't
take him to Berlin. Too far. Don't know the way, either'; and he said--fast, like a shot--said, 'But there's
Kiel'; and I knew--"

</p><p n="6.52">"What?" Bogard said. Without moving, his whole body sprang. "Kiel? In
this?"

</p><p n="6.53">"Absolutely. Ronnie thought of it. Smart, even if he is a stickler. Said at once, 'Zeebrugge no
show at all for that chap. Must do best we can for him. Berlin,' Ronnie said. 
'My <app><lem wit="first-ed">gad!</lem><rdg wit="SEP">gad!</rdg><rdg wit="reader">Gad!</rdg></app> Berlin.'"

</p><p n="6.54">"Listen," Bogard said. He had turned now, facing the other, his face quite grave. "What is
this boat for?"

</p><p n="6.55">"For?"

</p><p n="6.56">"What does it do?" Then, knowing beforehand the answer to his own
question, he said, putting his hand on the cylinder: "What is this in here? A torpedo, isn't it?"

</p><p n="6.57">"I
thought you knew," the boy said.

</p><p n="6.58">"No," Bogard said. "I didn't know." His voice seemed to reach
him from a distance, dry, cricketlike: "How do you fire it?"

</p><p n="6.59">"Fire it?"

</p><p n="6.60">"How do you get it
out of the boat? When that hatch was open a while ago I could see the engines. They were right in front of
the end of this tube."

</p><p n="6.61">"Oh," the boy said. "You pull a gadget there and the torpedo drops out astern.
As soon as the screw touches the water it begins to turn, and then the torpedo is ready, loaded. Then all you
have to do is turn the boat quickly and the torpedo goes on."

</p><p n="6.62">"You mean--" Bogard said. After a
moment his voice obeyed him again. "You mean you aim the torpedo with the boat and release it and it
starts moving, and you turn the boat out of the way and the torpedo passes through the same water that the
boat just vacated?"

</p><p n="6.63">"Knew you'd catch on," the boy said. "Told Ronnie so. Airman. Tamer than
yours, though. But can't be helped. Best we can do, just on water. But knew you'd catch
on."

</p><p n="6.64">"Listen," Bogard said. His voice sounded to him quite calm. The boat fled on, yawing over the
swells. He sat quite motionless. It seemed to him that he could hear himself talking to himself: "Go on. Ask
him. Ask him what? Ask him how close to the ship do you have to be before you fire . . . . Listen," he said,
in that calm voice. "Now, you tell Ronnie, you see. You just tell him--just say--" He could feel his voice
ratting off on him again, so he stopped it. He sat quite motionless, waiting for it to come back; the boy
leaning now, looking at his face. Again the boy's voice was solicitous:

</p><p n="6.65">"I say. You're not feeling
well. These confounded shallow boats."

</p><p n="6.66">"It's not that," Bogard said. "I just-- Do your orders say
Kiel?"

</p><p n="6.67">"Oh, no. They let Ronnie say. Just so we bring the boat back. This is for you. Gratitude.
Ronnie's idea. Tame, after flying. But if you'd rather, eh?"

</p><p n="6.68">"Yes, some place closer. You see, I--"

</p><p n="6.69">"Quite. I see. No vacations in wartime. I'll tell Ronnie." He went forward. Bogard did not
move.

</p><p n="6.70"> The boat fled in long, slewing swoops. Bogard looked quietly astern, at the scudding sea,
the sky.

</p><p n="6.71">"My God!" he thought. "Can you beat it? Can you beat it?"

</p><p n="6.72">The boy came back;
Bogard turned to him a face the color of dirty paper. "All right now," the boy said. "Not Kiel. Nearer place,
hunting probably just as good. Ronnie says he knows you will understand." He was tugging at his pocket.
He brought out a bottle. "Here. Haven't forgot last night. Do the same for you. Good for the stomach,
eh?"

</p><p n="6.73">Bogard drank, gulping--a big one. He extended the bottle, but the boy refused. "Never touch it
on duty," he said. "Not like you chaps. Tame here."

</p><p n="6.74">The boat fled on. The sun was already down
the west. But Bogard had lost all count of time, of distance. Ahead he could see white seas through the
round eye opposite Ronnie's face, and Ronnie's hand on the wheel and the granitelike jut of his profiled jaw
and the dead upside-down pipe. The boat fled on.

</p><p n="6.75">Then the boy leaned and touched his shoulder.
He half rose. The boy was pointing. The sun was reddish; against it, outside them and about two miles
away, a vessel--a trawler, it looked like--at anchor swung a tall mast.

</p><p n="6.76">"Lightship!" the boy shouted.
"Theirs." Ahead Bogard could see a low, flat mole--the entrance to a harbor. "Channel!" the boy shouted.
He swept his arm in both directions. "Mines!" His voice swept back on the wind. "Place filthy with them.
All sides. Beneath us too. Lark, eh?"</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section" n="7">
<head>VII</head>

<p n="7.1">Against the mole a fair surf was
beating. Running before the seas now, the boat seemed to leap from one roller to the next; in the intervals
while the screw was in the air the engine seemed to be trying to tear itself out by the roots. But it did not
slow; when it passed the end of the mole the boat seemed to be standing almost erect on its rudder, like a
sail-fish. The mole was a mile away. From the end of it little faint lights began to flicker like fireflies. The
boy leaned. "Down," he said. "Machine guns. Might stop a stray."

</p><p n="7.2">"What do I do?" Bogard
shouted. "What can I do?"

</p><p n="7.3">"Stout fellow! Give them hell, what? Knew you'd like
it!"

</p><p n="7.4">Crouching, Bogard looked up at the boy, his face wild. "I can handle the machine
gun!"

</p><p n="7.5">"No need," the boy shouted back. "Give them first innings. Sporting. Visitors, eh?" He was
looking forward. "There she is. See?" They were in the harbor now, the basin opening before them.
Anchored in the channel was a big freighter. Painted midships of the hull was a huge Argentine flag. "Must
get back to stations!" the boy shouted down to him. Then at that moment Ronnie spoke for the first time.
The boat was hurtling along now in smoother water. Its speed did not slacken and Ronnie did not turn his
head when he spoke. He just swung his jutting jaw and the clamped cold pipe a little, and said from the
side of his mouth a single word:

</p><p n="7.6">"Beaver."

</p><p n="7.7">The boy, stooped over what he had called his
gadget, jerked up, his expression astonished and outraged. Bogard also looked forward and saw Ronnie's
arm pointing to starboard. It was a light cruiser at anchor a mile away. She had basket masts, and as he
looked a gun flashed from her after turret. "Oh, damn!" the boy cried. "Oh, you putt! Oh, confound you,
Ronnie! Now I'm three down!" But he had already stooped again over his gadget, his face bright and empty
and alert again; not sober; just calm, waiting. Again Bogard looked forward and felt the boat pivot on its
rudder and head directly for the freighter at terrific speed, Ronnie now with one hand on the wheel and the
other lifted and extended at the height of his head.

</p><p n="7.8">But it seemed to Bogard that the hand would
never drop. He crouched, not sitting, watching with a kind of quiet horror the painted flag increase like a
moving picture of a locomotive taken from between the rails. Again the gun crashed from the cruiser
behind them, and the freighter fired point-blank at them from its poop. Bogard heard neither
shot.

</p><p n="7.9">"Man, man!" he shouted. "For God's sake!"

</p><p n="7.10">Ronnie's hand dropped. Again the boat
spun on its rudder. Bogard saw the bow rise, pivoting; he expected the hull to slam broadside on into the
ship. But it didn't. It shot off on a long tangent. He was waiting for it to make a wide sweep, heading
seaward, putting the freighter astern, and he thought of the cruiser again. "Get a broadside, this time, once
we clear the freighter," he thought. Then he remembered the freighter, the torpedo, and he looked back
toward the freighter to watch the torpedo strike, and saw to his horror that the boat was now bearing down
on the freighter again, in a skidding turn. Like a man in a dream, he watched himself rush down upon the
ship and shoot past under her counter, still skidding, close enough to see the faces on her decks. "They
missed and they are going to run down the torpedo and catch it and shoot it again," he thought
idiotically.

</p><p n="7.11">So the boy had to touch his shoulder before he knew he was behind him. The boy's
voice was quite calm: "Under Ronnie's seat there. A bit of a crank handle. If you'll just hand it to me--"

</p><p n="7.12">He found the crank. He passed it back; he was thinking dreamily: "Mac would say they had a
telephone on board." But he didn't look at once to see what the boy was doing with it, for in that still and
peaceful horror he was watching Ronnie, the cold pipe rigid in his jaw, hurling the boat at top speed round
and round the freighter, so near that he could see the rivets in the plates. Then he looked aft, his face wild,
importunate, and he saw what the boy was doing with the crank. He had fitted it into what was obviously a
small windlass low on one flank of the tube near the head. He glanced up and saw Bogard's face. "Didn't
go that time!" he shouted cheerfully.

</p><p n="7.13">"Go?" Bogard shouted. "It didn't-- The torpedo--"

</p><p n="7.14">The boy and one of the seamen were quite busy, stooping over the windlass and the tube. "No.
Clumsy. Always happening. Should think clever chaps like engineers-- Happens, though. Draw her in and
try her again."

</p><p n="7.15">"But the nose, the cap!" Bogard shouted. "It's still in the tube, isn't it? It's all right,
isn't it?"

</p><p n="7.16">"Absolutely. But it's working now. Loaded. Screw's started turning. Get it back and drop it
clear. If we should stop or slow up it would overtake us. Drive back into the tube. Bingo!
What?"

</p><p n="7.17">Bogard was on his feet now, turned, braced to the terrific merry-go-round of the boat. High
above them the freighter seemed to be spinning on her heel like a trick picture in the movies. "Let me have
that winch!" he cried.

</p><p n="7.18">"Steady!" the boy said. "Mustn't draw her back too fast. Jam her into the
head of the tube ourselves. Same bingo! Best let us. Every cobbler to his last, what?"

</p><p n="7.19">"Oh, quite,"
Bogard said. "Oh, absolutely." It was like someone else was using his mouth. He leaned, braced, his hands
on the cold tube, beside the others. He was hot inside, but his outside was cold. He could feel all his flesh
jerking with cold as he watched the blunt, grained hand of the seaman turning the windlass in short, easy,
inch-long arcs, while at the head of the tube the boy bent, tapping the cylinder with a spanner, lightly, his
head turned with listening, delicate and deliberate as a watchmaker. The boat rushed on in those furious,
slewing turns. Bogard saw a long, drooping thread loop down from somebody's mouth, between his hands,
and he found that the thread came from his own mouth.

</p><p n="7.20">He didn't hear the boy speak, nor notice
when he stood up. He just felt the boat straighten out, flinging him to his knees beside the tube. The
seaman had gone back to the stern and the boy stooped again over his gadget. Bogard knelt now, quite sick.
He did not feel the boat when it swung again, nor hear the gun from the cruiser which had not dared to fire
and the freighter which had not been able to fire, firing again. He did not feel anything at all when he saw
the huge, painted flag directly ahead and increasing with locomotive speed, and Ronnie's lifted hand drop.
But this time he knew that the torpedo was gone; in pivoting and spinning this time the whole boat seemed
to leave the water; he saw the bow of the boat shoot skyward like the nose of a pursuit ship going into a
wingover. Then his outraged stomach denied him. He saw neither the geyser nor heard the detonation as he
sprawled over the tube. He felt only a hand grasp him by the slack of his coat, and the voice of one of the
seamen: "Steady all, sir. I've got you."</p>

<head>VIII</head>

<p n="8.1">A voice roused him, a hand.
He was half sitting in the narrow starboard runway, half lying across the tube. He had been there for quite a
while; quite a while ago he had felt someone spread a garment over him. But he had not raised his head.
"I'm all right," he had said. "You keep it."

</p><p n="8.2">"Don't need it," the boy said. "Going home
now."

</p><p n="8.3">"I'm sorry I--" Bogard said.

</p><p n="8.4">"Quite. Confounded shallow boats. Turn any stomach
until you get used to them. Ronnie and I both, at first. Each time. You wouldn't believe it. Believe human
stomach hold so much. Here." It was the bottle. "Good drink. Take enormous one. Good for
stomach."

</p><p n="8.5">Bogard drank. Soon he did feel better, warmer. When the hand touched him later, he
found that he had been asleep.

</p><p n="8.6">It was the boy again. The pea-coat was too small for him; shrunken,
perhaps. Below the cuffs his long, slender, girl's wrists were blue with cold. Then Bogard realized what the
garment was that had been laid over him. But before Bogard could speak, the boy leaned down,
whispering; his face was gleeful: "He didn't notice!"

</p><p n="8.7">"What?"

</p><p n="8.8">"Ergenstrasse! He didn't
notice that they had shifted her. Gad, I'd be just one down, then." He watched Bogard's face with bright,
eager eyes. "Beaver, you know. I say. Feeling better, eh?"

</p><p n="8.9">"Yes," Bogard said, "I am."

</p><p n="8.10">"He
didn't notice at all. Oh, gad! Oh, Jove!"

</p><p n="8.11">Bogard rose and sat on the tube. The entrance to the harbor
was just ahead; the boat had slowed a little. It was just dusk. He said quietly: "Does this often happen?"
The boy looked at him. Bogard touched the tube. "This. Failing to go out."

</p><p n="8.12">"Oh, yes. Why they put
the windlass on them. That was later. Made first boat; whole thing blew up one day. So put on windlass."


</p><p n="8.13">"But it happens sometimes, even now? I mean, sometimes they blow up, even with the
windlass?"

</p><p n="8.14">"Well, can't say, of course. Boats go out. Not come back. Possible. Not ever know, of
course. Not heard of one captured yet, though. Possible. Not to us, though. Not yet."

</p><p n="8.15">"Yes," Bogard
said. "Yes." They entered the harbor, the boat moving still fast, but throttled now and smooth, across the
dusk-filled basin. Again the boy leaned down, his voice gleeful.

</p><p n="8.16">"Not a word, now!" he hissed.
"Steady all!" He stood up; he raised his voice: "I say, Ronnie." Ronnie did not turn his head, but Bogard
could tell that he was listening. "That Argentine ship was amusing, eh? In there. How do you suppose it got
past us here? Might have stopped here as well. French would buy the wheat." He paused, 
diabolical--Machiavelli 
with the face of a strayed angel. "I say. How long has it been since we had a strange ship in
here? Been months, eh?" Again he leaned, hissing. "Watch, now!" But Bogard could not see Ronnie's head
move at all. "He's looking, though!" the boy whispered, breathed. And Ronnie was looking, though his
head had not moved at all. Then there came into view, in silhouette against the dusk-filled sky, the vague,
basket-like shape of the interned vessel's foremast. At once Ronnie's arm rose, pointing; again he spoke
without turning his head, out of the side of his mouth, past the cold, clamped pipe, a single
word:

</p><p n="8.17">"Beaver."

</p><p n="8.18">The boy moved like a released spring, like a heeled dog freed. "Oh, damn
you!" he cried. "Oh, you putt! It's the Ergenstrasse! Oh, confound you! I'm just one down now!" He had
stepped in one stride completely over Bogard, and he now leaned down over Ronnie. "What?" The boat
was slowing in toward the wharf, the engine idle. "Aren't I, Ronnie? Just one down now?"

</p><p n="8.19">The
boat drifted in; the seaman had again crawled forward onto the deck. Ronnie spoke for the third and last
time. "Right," he said.</p>

<p n="9.1">"I want," Bogard said, "a case of Scotch. The
best we've got. And fix it up good. It's to go to town. And I want a responsible man to deliver it."

</p><p n="9.2">
The responsible man came. "This is for a child," Bogard said, indicating the package. "You'll find him in
the Street of the Twelve Hours, somewhere near the Café Twelve Hours. He'll be in the gutter.
You'll know him. A child about six feet long. Any English M. P. will show him to you. If he is asleep, don't
wake him. Just sit there and wait until he wakes up. Then give him this. Tell him it is from Captain
Bogard."</p>

<p n="10.1">About a month later a copy of the English Gazette which had
strayed onto an American aerodrome carried the following item in the casualty
lists:

</p><p n="10.2"><q>MISSING: Torpedo Boat XOOI. 
<app><lem wit="first-ed">Midshipmen</lem><rdg wit="reader">Midshipmen</rdg><rdg wit="SEP">Ensigns</rdg></app> R. Boyce Smith and L. C. W. Hope, R. N. R.,

Torpedo Division. Failed to return from coast patrol duty.</q>

</p><p n="10.3">Shortly after that the American Air
Service headquarters also issued a bulletin:

</p><p n="10.4"><q>For extraordinary valor over and beyond the
routine of duty, Captain H. S. Bogard, with his crew, composed of Second Lieutenant Darrel McGinnis and
Aviation Gunners Watts and Harper, on a daylight raid and without scout protection, destroyed with bombs
an ammunition depot several miles behind the enemy's lines. From here, beset by enemy aircraft in
superior numbers, these men proceeded with what bombs remained to the enemy's corps headquarters at
<app><lem wit="first-ed">Blank</lem><rdg wit="reader">Blank</rdg><rdg wit="SEP">----</rdg></app> and partially demolished this
château, and then returned safely without loss of a man.</q>

</p><p n="10.5">And regarding which
exploit, it might have added, had it failed and had Captain Bogard come out of it alive, he would
have been immediately and thoroughly court-martialed.

</p><p n="10.6">Carrying his remaining two bombs, he had
dived the Handley-Page at the château where the generals sat at lunch, until McGinnis, at the toggles
below him, began to shout at him, before he ever signaled. He didn't signal until he could discern
separately the slate tiles of the roof. Then his hand dropped and he zoomed, and he held the aeroplane so,
in its wild snarl, his lips parted, his breath hissing, thinking: "God! God! If they were all there--all the
generals, the admirals, the presidents and the kings--theirs, ours--all of them."</p>
